I couldn't find anything decent.

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,960
New house, new wardrobe,
but it's still the same old mess.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,280
What the hell are you doing here?

44
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,200
You're sick people. You know that?

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,520
You deviants!
Freaks! Filthy perverts!

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,920
Massimo,
you have to get out of here!

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,640
It brings bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding.

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
Not to say to bang her
and ruin her makeup!

49
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,080
You're driving me crazy.
You'd give Grandma Krysia a heart attack.

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,800
- Are you jealous?
- Listen to me.

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,400
Please have some respect
for Polish tradition, okay?

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
If you want, next time you can join us.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,800
Go, go, go!

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,760
<i>Adiós, amigos. Ciao, bella!</i>

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,440
Or whatever you people say.

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,280
See you later, alligator!

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,440
It was supposed to be perfect.
The wedding, the dress, and you.

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,520
And I was supposed to be relaxing.

59
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,160
Just look at you.

60
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,080
I'm not gonna get on your ass about it,
but you never smoke.

61
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,680
Whatever. If you wanna pretend
to be a badass, fine.

62
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,880
But I need to know something.

63
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,240
You haven't told him, have you?

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay. None of my business.

65
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,840
You've been trying
to tell him, though, right?

66
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,040
I think about it every day.

67
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,880
Massimo can never know I was pregnant.

68
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,040
That's great.

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,040
A dark secret is the foundation
of any successful relationship.

70
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,680
What should I do?

71
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
Tell him I lost the baby
in the tunnel where I almost died?

72
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Do you know what he'd do?

73
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
What?

74
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,200
These people aren't normal.

75
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
A war would break out.

76
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
A war? Come on.

77
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,320
You know Massimo.

78
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,120
He never lets things go.

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
Know what a "vendetta" is?

80
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,480
Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,480
You do realize we're in Sicily, right?

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,520
I mean, I've heard the word before.

83
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,080
In movies. Who hasn't?
Of course I know what it means.

84
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,880
Oh shit.

85
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,760
I wasn't thinking.

86
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,280
It was the hardest decision of my life.

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,960
You're the strongest woman I've ever met.
You know that?

89
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,880
Remember, you're not alone.
I'm here for you.

90
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,560
So, do you love him?

91
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Okay, let's go.

92
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,440
Help me get ready.

93
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,320
I promise I won't forget
my panties this time.

94
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,360
Here you go. Pick any color you like.

95
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,240

163
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,680
Like the first time, baby.

164
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,200
It will be
a perfect honeymoon, husband.

You changed your hair!

212
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,360
Welcome home!

213
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,080
Nice to see you too.
I didn't know we had to bring food.

214
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,200
Listen...

215
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,960
I'm living my best life. I fell in love.

216
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,560
And when exactly did that happen?

217
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,120
You're the last person
who should be criticizing me.

218
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,480
I'm wondering how many pieces
of furniture I'll need to replace.

219
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,360
Would you be so kind as to make a list
of everything that's been tainted?

220
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,240
Want a raspberry?
In Italian, it's called <i>"lampone."</i>

221
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,720
You can stick your <i>lampone</i>
up your ass.

222
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,000
I would like to propose
you two catch up in a different location

223
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,600
'cause Domenico,
now he needs to focus on work.

224
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,800
Of course, when he's wearing
a normal suit and not...

225
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
What is that, a... a cake or something?

226
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Cream.

227
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,280
Um,
I arranged a little trip for you two.

228
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,760
Do I look like furniture
that you can move around?

229
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,520
- I want you to have fun with your friend.
- Oh, really?

230
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,960
- It's not a joke.
- Why don't you put a leash on me?

231
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,520
Oh, I can see honeymoon is over.

232
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,640
Shut up.

233
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,280
Calm down. We could use a vacation.

234
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,280
It's been so long,
I've forgotten what alcohol looks like.

235
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,480
- I'll be in the office.
- All right.

236
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
What's on your mind?

237
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,720
Nothing. I'm just enjoying being here.

238
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,600
- Is that why you're acting so serious?
- I'm not.

239
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,360
I just feel bad about Massimo.

240
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,000
He's making a real effort.
He arranged this trip.

241
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,040
Sometimes I think I'm just like my mom.

242
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Uh-uh.

243
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,440
Nope. Even worse. You're a typical wife.

244
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,760
Thanks, Olga. I can always count on you.

245
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,320
No worries. Happy to help.

246
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,760
Listen. It's simple, really.

247
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,840
You know what Massimo likes,
so just do that.

248
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Oh shit!

249
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560

303
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,680
At least be dressed.

304
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,480
Or just be out from under him!

305
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,920
We need to finish.

- What?

314
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,080
I drive around Włochy in Warsaw.
If I can do it there, I can do it here.

315
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
Hop in.

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,560
Okay.

317
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,720
Move out.

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,080
- No. Want me to sit and wave?
- Scoot over. Come on.

319
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,840
Okay. I'll sit and wave.

320
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,760
I like it.
Just look at me, sitting and waving.

321
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,800
Bye!

322
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,400

No.

340
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,920
Remember your mom hanging out the window
with a plate in her hand?

341
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,120
Mom!

342
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,000
How old were we back then? Six?

343
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,360
Mm-hmm. Even back then,
you had powder on your plate.

344
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,080
Hey! It was just powdered Jell-O.

345
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,240
We ate it with our fingers
and went roller-skating. Remember?

346
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,120
Ah.

347
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Honestly? I prefer life now,
20 years later.

348
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,720
My skates weren't as fast as the Ferrari.
Not for lack of trying.

349
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,320
You know what?

350
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
What?

351
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,080
It doesn't matter
what we drive or what we eat,

352
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,800
as long as we're together.

353
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Forever.

354
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,040
With you, I don't even mind
having to walk everywhere.

355
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,520

Great, thanks.

362
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,480
I've missed this.

363
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,600
Mm-hmm.

364
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,560
Lately,
everything's gone sideways.

365
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,560
Yep.

366
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Oh shit.

367
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,680
Hi there!

368
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,840
I guess we're not having dessert.

369
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,080
We're leaving.

370
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,000
Did you hear that?

371
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,080
I said... we're leaving.

372
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,440
Don Massimo Torricelli,

373
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,640
I have needs.

374
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,720
I know that our beginnings
were quite rough,

375
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,960
or more like sick.

376
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,000
You've kidnapped me, and this is sick.

377
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,080
But I fell in love with you,
and we <i>are </i>together because <i>I</i> decided.

378
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,880
You cannot control people,
and I won't let you control me.

379
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,760
- I'm your wife, not one of your soldiers.
- What are you talking about?

380
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,720
- I just want to protect you.
- This is not protection.

381
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
This is prison.

382
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,240
I can't live without doing anything.

383
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,640
I miss challenges.

384
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,920
You're right, my girl.
I screwed this up.

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,360
Mrs. Torricelli, right?

391
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,680
I didn't want to disturb you.

392
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,120
Mrs. Torricelli, right?

393
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Yeah.

394
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Laura.

395
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,920
I'm the new gardener, Nacho.

396
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Nacho?

397
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,080
Nacho. Nice to meet you.

398
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,120
You have a nice cap.

399
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,160
Yes, I know. Thank you.

400
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,440
But Nacho?
It doesn't sound very Italian.

401
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
It's a nickname.

402
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,760
My family has Spanish roots.

403
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,000
And you? Where are you from?

404
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,160
Poland.

405
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Thirsty?

406
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Oh, yes.

407
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Thank you.

408
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,720
How long have you been working
for my husband?

409
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,440
I just started.

410
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,000
Mr. Torricelli wants
some changes in the garden.

411
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
I have to work.

412
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,440
I wouldn't like to waste
your precious time.

413
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,320
Wasting my time?

414
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,280
You're talking to a person
who has absolutely nothing to do.

415
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,480
Now my only job is being a... wife.

416
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,160
How pathetic is that?

417
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,520
You're wrong, missus.

418
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,000
Being a good wife is one
of the most difficult jobs in the world.

419
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,920
Oh.

420
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,440
It's why I'm so perfect at it.

421
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,400
'Cause I don't have to do anything.

422
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,080
They cook for me. They clean for me.
Even they cut flowers for me.

423
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,400
It's why I'm so perfect at doing nothing.

424
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,920
You are a real busy bee.

425
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,160
That's a great talent.

426
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,200
To be perfect without doing anything.

427
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,640
Please don't tell me
that you also make money by doing nothing.

428
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,560
Where do you think it all comes from?

429
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,720
You need to teach me that.

430
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,480
Mrs. Torricelli!

431
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,440
I must go. Thank you for the water.

432
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,560
Ah. I will cut some flowers for you.

433
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,120

434

Thank you for arranging
the arrival of my parents.

544
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,040
It was a wonderful gift.

545
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,560
Anything for you.

546
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,720
Don't you miss your family?

547
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
Because, besides Domenico,
you have nobody.

548
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,480
You had Mario.

549
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,640
It was Mario's own decision to retire.

550
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,160
I didn't make him do it.

551
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,200
He couldn't deal with...

552
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,040
After the accident,
he was blaming himself for what happened,

553
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,800
but I know that he couldn't do anything.

554
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,040
But... he's a man of honor.

555
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,280
And I've lost my right hand.

556
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,800
Yeah.

557
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,000
I know how important he was in your life.

558
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,000
Sometimes I think that, uh,

559
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,320
you feel so lonely...

560
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,520
'cause besides me, you have no one.

561
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,880
No parents, no siblings.

562
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,560
I have a brother.

563
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,400
But I'd rather not have him.

564
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,520
But... correct me if I'm wrong...

565
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,600
Do we still have something to try out?

566
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,480
You have a brother?
And you didn't tell me about this before?

567
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,680
I still have some work to do.

568
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,640
No, do not tell me
that you're about to leave.

569
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,560
Massimo.

570
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,480
Massimo!

571
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,400
This is one hell of a present.

572
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,240
Hello, ladies. I am Emily.

573
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,080
- Hello.
- I'm glad you're here.

574
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,920
Thank you so much.

575
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,120
I'm Laura,
and this is my best friend, Olga.

576
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,720
Hello!

577
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,960
Hi.

578
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,400
Let's go.

579
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,920
Luxury is my middle name.

580
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,560
- Do you like it?
- Amazing.

581
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,240
If I understand correctly,
we have to talk about business

582
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,800
after the New Year.

583
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,080
And today we have to make you look
like superstars. Is that right?

584
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,560
Sure, sure.
But remember, I'm the hot goddess.

585
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,440
You get used to her.

586
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Or not.

587
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,680
Mia, can we begin?

588
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
Of course.

Laura, what's going on?

612
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,280
- Nothing.
- What do you mean? Something's wrong.

613
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,760
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Do I have to force it out of you?

614
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,400
I'm pissed off at Massimo.

615
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,160
But I'm not discussing it
with him or with you.

616
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,720
I get it. I respect your decision.
Booze would help.

617
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,360
It's enough for me.
I want to go back.

618
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,200
Excuse me.

619
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,016
Can't you see
I'm in the middle of a conversation?

620
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,880
Yeah. You're so gentle, talking to him,

621
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,240
but talking to me,
it's a different situation, right?

622
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,960
I have one more last conversation.

623
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,040
Yeah.

624
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,560
Right.

625
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,280
I'll do my best to be quick.

626
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,560
All conversations
are more important than one with me.

627
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,760
Excuse me.

628
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,160
Thanks for inviting us.
I haven't had this much fun in ages.

629
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,320
Mom, I'm not sure
I can say the same about Dad.

630
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,560
If the love of my life
is having fun, so am I.

631
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,840
You know what?

632
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,600
You've been married for 30 years,

633
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,000
and I wish Massimo looked at me
the same way Dad looks at you.

634
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:18,640
Sweetie, you need to understand
that marriage is about compromise.

635
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,280
Don't you agree, honey?

636
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,360
I wouldn't dare think otherwise.

637
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,600
And now... let's dance. Just you and me.

638
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,360
Laura?

639
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,840
Do you feel okay?

640
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,040
Get me out from here.

641
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,080
Can you stop the car, please?

642
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,160
My God.

643
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,600
How could he be so stupid? And with her?

644
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,760
I wish I could go away from here
and never come back.

645
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,600
I'm flying home in a few hours.

646
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,040
We will find a ticket...

647
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,000
if you want to sort things out...
away from here.

648
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,920
Wait for a second.

649
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,896
<i>The number you are trying
to reach is currently unavailable.</i>

650
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,760
<i>Please try again later.</i>

651
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,440
Mom, I'm sorry.
You were right.

652
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,480
I was wrong about Massimo.

653
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,800
After what I saw, I don't want
to see him ever again. Obviously.

654
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,120
I need to get away
for a while and collect my thoughts.

655
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,080
Don't worry about me. I'm safe.

656
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,160
I love you. I'll call in a few days.

657
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,520
Take me anywhere,
but take me away from here.

658
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,400
Wow, you look great.

659
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,200
I like you in this outfit.

660
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,240
I took what I found in the closet.

661
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,560
Maybe it's your girlfriend's?

662
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,840
I think she prefers a sporty style.

663
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,720
Sister's.
I don't have a girlfriend, Laura.

664
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,680
These are my sister's clothes.

665
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
Come.

666
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Dinner is ready.

667
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,280
Look what I made for you.
My favorite dish.

668
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,960
- Paella.
- But dinner?

669
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,840
Did I sleep so long?

670
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,760
It's so nice here.

671
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,520
It's my father's house.

672
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,440
Anyway, my sister Amelia
will come by later.

673
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,800
I think you will like each other.

674
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,480
She's a cool girl.

675
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,840
She's a bit moody.

676
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,920
You know,

677
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,920
pregnancy hormones.

678
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,120
Your sister is pregnant. I'm sorry.

679
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,200
Oh.

680
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,480
Are you okay?

681
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,720
It's just a pity
she chose an asshole for the father.

682
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,080
Wait a moment.

683
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,680
I have to clean.

684
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,400
I'm gonna kill him!
Excuse me. Leave me alone!

685
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,640
Let her through.

686
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,760
I have no idea where she...

687
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,280
What did you do to her?
What did you do to my daughter?

688
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,120
She recorded a message
saying she was leaving you.

689
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,400
She never wants to see you again.

690
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,440
I knew you were a bad person
since I met you.

691
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,360
I don't know what you did to her,
but I know one thing.

692
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,160
If my daughter decided to leave you,

693
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:21,320
she has a damn good reason for it!

694
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,360
We are going back to Poland.

695
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,760
We'll wait for her to come home.

696
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,640
My husband is already in the car.

697
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,800
Don't try to stop me.

698
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,240
Bring me Davide and Tommaso.
Now.

699
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,880

Ignacio has been so sweet
since I'm pregnant.

709
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,080
I'm treated like a queen.

710
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,080
How do you know
that Nacho doesn't like him?

711
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,280
Because he's Sicilian.

712
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,960
I used to like Sicilians.

713
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,680
You used to <i>love </i>the Sicilians.

714
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,480
That's even worse.

715
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,080
Wow.

716
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,040
I can see that your brother
takes care a lot about you.

717
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,640
Yeah, Nacho is wonderful. The best.

718
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,840
Just don't tell him
I said that.

719
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,400
I would like to see him
finally settle down with some nice girl.

720
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,800
Like you. He deserves it.

721
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,760
How do you know I'm nice? You just met me.

722
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,040
Intuition. It never disappoints me.

723
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,080
And there is something
between you two, I hope.

724
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,600
Oh, really?

725
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,080
But you know, my life got complicated,
so right now, I have to fix it.

726
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,640
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

727
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,160
And you know
that Nacho worked for me as a gardener?

728
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:22,360
As a gardener?

729
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,920
Oh my God,
my brother will never cease to amaze me.

730
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,240
So, you didn't know
what he was doing in Sicily?

731
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,120
Honey, you can't keep up
with Nacho.

732
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,520
He's the most spontaneous person I know,
and he's also very loyal to his family.

733
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,240
Maybe too loyal sometimes.

734
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,480
Nacho!

735
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,200
- I did my hair and makeup. Come on.
- Sorry.

736
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,760
Ah.

737
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,280
I forgive you.

738
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,240
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

739
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,040
A Sicilian man
can only be understood

740
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,680
by a woman born and raised in Sicily.

741
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,520
You can't expect a woman
who's been living a normal life in Poland

742
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,520
to be able to handle life with...

743
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,880
...an extraordinary man such as yourself.

744
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,520
Let's put all that behind us.

745
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:44,720
Let's join forces and unite our families.

746
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,880
We will be indestructible.

747
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,360
Thanks for coming.

748
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,960
I had my doubts, but now I'm sure.

749
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,240
Laura didn't leave on her own.

750
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,680
You were involved.

751
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,400
I'll find out what happened,

752
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,160
and you'll get what you deserve.

758
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,920
You're so good at it.

759
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,400
I'm not sure
if it was a compliment

760
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,840
or you just cut my balls.

761
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Anyway,

762
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,720
thank you.

763
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,200
I miss him.

764
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,040
I know.

765
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,840
But tell me one thing.

766
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,120
Why always good girls
fall in love with bad guys?

767
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,400
How do you know I'm good?

768
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,280
Maybe something's wrong with me
because he cheated on me.

769
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,360
Laura...

770
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,520
don't you ever say that again.

771
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,080
It's not your fault.

772
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,760
A guy cheating on a woman like you
must be an idiot.

773
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,640
Without balls.

774
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,800
Do you understand?

775
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,360
You understand.

776
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,520

I should have listened
to my intuition.

801
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,720
Come in.

802
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,320
What do you want?

803
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,600
I have a message.

804
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,960
Spit it out. I don't have all day.

805
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,080
She's not in Sicily.

806
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,320
- What did you say?
- How come?

807
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,640
She left with him.

808
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,000
Please, don't.

809
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,760
I'm just...

810
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,560
You're just a clown.

811
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,040
You just screwed up our plan.

812
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,160
Everything was ready.
All you had to do was pick her up.

813
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,440
Will you take care of him...

814
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:10,400
...or should I do it?

815
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,560
Okay, calm down. Relax.

816
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,200
Have a seat on the couch, okay?

817
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:18,880
I will take care of it.
Come on, now. Easy. Come on.

818
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,960
Okay. Shh.

819
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,600
Relax. It's all right.

820
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,680
Hey.

821
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,080
Hey. Don't worry, okay?

822
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:35,960
Have somebody clean up this mess.

823
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,920
Fuck. My pants.

824
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,200
They're new.

825
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:31,000
Hello?

826
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,840
Yes.

827
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:36,920
Yes. Okay.

828
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,160
Thank you.

829
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,000
We got confirmation.

830
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,320
He's on the island with him.

831
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,240
Everything is ready.

832
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,160
He's waiting for the green light.

833
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,880
I know what to do
in this kind of situation.

834
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,040
We can't be compared to this scum.

835
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,480
You know you can only rely on...

836
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,560
Hey!

837
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,080
...on yourself.

838
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,240
I'm here too,
if you haven't noticed.

839
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:23,600
And if you are talking about Laura,
I want to know everything, you understand?

840
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,360
Pumpkin, we're trying to do business...

841
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,760
Don't "pumpkin" me!

842
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,600
Laura is fucking gone,

843
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,400
and you're talking about business?

844
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,520
No fucking way!

845
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,000
Baby, please calm down.

846
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,480
I can't calm down. I'm Polish.

847
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,560
Dammit.

848
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,880
Wait. Wait.

849
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,800
Sit down.

Unfortunately not. He will be fine.

883
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,800
For now.

884
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
Are you okay?

885
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,520
What happened last night?

886
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,200
Don't think about it.

887
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,120
You are safe here.

888
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:51,720
Tell me.

889
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,600
Someone broke in.

890
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:01,240
It's over now.
The police will take care of it.

891
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,760
But... why would anyone
break into your house?

892
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,920
And why can an ordinary gardener
like you have all of this?

893
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:19,520
What a luxury life.

894
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,880
I told you.

895
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,320
My father is a wealthy man.

896
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,320
I'm trying to become independent of him.

897
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,040
Enjoy.

898
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,560
Sorry, 'cause you helped me
in a very difficult moment in my life,

899
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,360
and right now, I take it out on you.

900
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,360
I deserve it.

901
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,280
You do not deserve it.

902
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,120
Sometimes I act so irrational.

903
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,680
I'm sorry.

904
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,040
Laura...

905
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,280
it's fine.

906
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,600
Now, let's eat. We have plans for today.

907
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:32,880
I do appreciate your good spirit,
but, you know, because of last night,

908
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,080
I don't have a good mood
to do anything special.

909
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,000
You're right.

910
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,560
It would be better if we stay at home
and get upset about last night.

911
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,160
So, where do you want to get upset?

912
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,360
In the dining room?

913
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,640
Or the dancing hall?

914
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:53,720
Or...

915
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,920
let me take you
to a place where you can smile.

916
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:05,000
I promise if you don't smile there,
we will come back here and weep together.

917
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,360

01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:36,040
Of course. Thanks.

940
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,880
What?

941
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,800
They weren't able to find her.

942
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,360

Yeah. That's true.

964
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,640
I usually come here
with all my girlfriends.

965
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,920
From Poland.

966
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,680
Any of those Polish girlfriends
ever escape from you?

967
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,240
Never.

968
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,760
Hold my beer.

969
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,720
I will leave you

970
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,560

971
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,880
Hi, guys.

01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

973
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,280
Wow, you look so gorgeous in that dress.

974
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,760
- Thank you.
- Ladies.

975

I can see
you won't be missing me too much.

976

do not come

Technically speaking, this is <i>my </i>bedroom

1053
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,320
that I'm sharing with you

1054
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,200
so you don't have to sleep on the beach.

to tell you that food is ready.

Ah.

or just an erotic dream?

1061
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,800

- With whom?

1062
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:14,720
With you.

1063
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,720
And did you like it to be?

1064
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,280
It was pretty good,
but in my entire life, I had better.

01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:29,760
This is my asylum.

01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:49,000
But for now, you're stuck here with me,
so... I'm not going anywhere... yet.

01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,240

And?
That makes you worried, or what?

1070
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:01,400
I've already met your sister,

1083
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,520
I am Marcelo "Nacho" Matos,

1084
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,560
son of Don Fernando Matos,

1085

the head of the local Mafia

So, your father told you
to bring me to the island?

1088
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,520
No. You came here because you wanted to.

1089
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,840
What if I didn't want to?

1090

I thought that you were my real friend

1094
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,160
and nothing was a coincidence.

1095
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:23,160
Laura, I wasn't faking
my feelings for you.

1096
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,080
So I guess I have to thank you.

1097
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,440
'Cause you proved that men aren't good.

1098
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,040
Only good at lying.

1099
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,600
You think I would fake all of this?

1100
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,320
Take you to the beach?

1101
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:48,400

1102
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,360
And the kiss?

1103
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,760
You didn't feel it was real?

1104
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,680
It was real, like a fairy tale.

1105
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,520
And if you think I would fall in love
again with a guy who thinks

1106
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:04,360
he can have me just like that,
you're absolutely wrong.

1107
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:07,600
'Cause I've learned from my mistakes,

1108
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,480
and I've learned
that you're a fuckin' liar.

1109
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,120
Laura.

1110
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:20,880
Be rational.

1111
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,320
I didn't make you come here.

1112
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,000
You came with me because you felt safe.

No.

1114
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,040

you hid the truth from me.

<i>♪ Time to summon my faith... ♪</i>

1121
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,040
I always dreamed of living
in a beach house

1122
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,440
and opening a surf school.

1123
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,120
I was just unlucky
to be born into the wrong family.

1124
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,840
My father had different plans for me.

1125
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:26,560
Laura, for God's sake,
you are the wife of a Mafia boss.

1126
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,400
You know how important
the loyalty is for the family.

1127
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,040
When the Mob boss is your father,

1128
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,840
you don't have much choice.

1129
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:39,160
No. You always have a choice.

1130
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,400
The thing is, you have to take
responsibility of your own life.

1131
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,600
We'll take care of her now.

1132
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,360
No. She's coming with me.

1133
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:35,400
Don Matos asked you to come alone.

1134
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:38,000
Nobody told me about that.

1135
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,840
He already has guests.

1136
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,600
Laura.

1137
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,160
What?

1138
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,360
- Be careful.
- Oh, really?

1139
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,120
I don't think anything worse
than the last few days could happen.

1140
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,480
Thank you for accepting
the invitation to the meeting.

1141
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,200
I didn't really have a choice.

1142
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,880
Oh, I would like to apologize
that we are meeting

1143
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:22,200
in such unpleasant circumstances,
but I believe that, as a businessman,

1144
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:25,120
you will understand
that the goal justifies the means.

1145
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,760
After all, the stakes are high.

1146
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:35,440
Our family had the non-aggression pact.

1147
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,080
You violated it.

1148
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:45,280
Oh, your father and I,
we were both men of honor.

1149
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,160
As long as he was alive,

1150
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:51,480
we both respected
the borders of our interests.

1151
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,000
But you, Massimo,

1152
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,920
you're expanding too much.

1153
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,440
Some people don't like it.

1154
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,400
Some people?

1155
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,800
Some people, who?

1156
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:09,360
You?

1157
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:12,920
We have been sending you
warnings.

1158
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Laura's accident.

1159
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,600
But you were too convinced
of your own strength.

1160
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,000
Your father was wise.

1161
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,080
He knew that no opponent
should be taken lightly.

1162
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,920
I cannot bear...

1163
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,120
more chances with you as a boss.

1164
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,200
All the families
would benefit from someone more, uh,

1165
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,720
controllable to be in your place.

1166
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:47,160
We figured your stupid brother
will do perfect.

1167
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,920
He's so blinded with revenge and greed

1168
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,480
that he doesn't care much
for the family business.

1169
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,360
You're wrong.

1170
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,960
You're wrong... if you think
I'm gonna put my father's empire

1171
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,560
into the hands of a dog.

1172
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,160
Sit down. Massimo...

1173
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:19,840
A traitor who put my dad
into the hands of Death!

1174
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,720
You're fucking wrong!

1175
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:31,080
Let me remind you
that your wife is still with us.

1176
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,200
You call yourself a man of honor?

1177
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,680
And you use my wife this way?

1178
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:53,920
Massimo, coming here
with Nacho was Laura's decision.

1179
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,760
Nobody made her do it.

1180
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,000
I need to see my wife.

1181
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:08,720
I need to see my wife. Now.

1182
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,640
Oh, I can assure you that she's safe.

1183
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:18,200
Marcelo brought her to the island
and has been taking care for her.

1184
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:22,240
Now she's with Miguel,
my personal bodyguard.

1185
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,840
Father.

1186
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,040
- You said Laura's with Miguel?
- Yes.

1187
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,640
I wanted to make sure she'd be safe.

1188
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:33,160
Laura left with Enrique
and the other bodyguard.

1189
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:41,480
What?

1190
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,160
Find her.

1191
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,320
We need to go. Now.

01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,240
Shh.

1202
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,240
You're not Massimo.

1203
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:49,680
No.

I'm not.

I am Adriano Torricelli.

1206
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:08,240
The twin brother who was so unlucky
because he was born ten minutes later.

1207
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,080
Ten minutes. Ten minutes.

1208
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:14,120
But it's nice to meet you,

1209
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,360
baby girl.

1210
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,360
Do not call me "baby girl."

1211
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:23,440
- Where is Massimo?
- He's not too far.

1212
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:27,240
Not too far.

1213
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:30,560
But I think
that you have to wait a little longer.

1214
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,840
He's a busy man.

1215
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:38,960
Yeah, I'm happy to spend
a lot of time with my new sister-in-law,

1216
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:42,400
you know, and have a little chat with her.

1217
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:44,520
We have nothing to talk about.

1218
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,960
I disagree.

1219
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,760
I'm gonna tell you a story
about taking back what's mine.

1220
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:56,200
I mean, my dad
is no longer an obstacle, yeah.

1221
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:00,760
And now...

1222
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:03,640
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,960
I have
to get rid of your husband.

1224
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,200
Don't worry, Laura.

1225
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,000
I won't leave you alone with him.

1226
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,360
What are you doing here?

1227
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,360
What does it look like I'm doing?

1228
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:42,360
I'm winning.

1229
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,800
Massimo made a huge mistake

1230
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,000
by underestimating the anger
of the abandoned woman.

1231
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,200
What are you doing here?

1232
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,600
You were supposed to wait in Sicily
until the negotiations were over.

1233
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,320
You know them?

1234
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,840
Honey, we were the ones
who pushed you into his arms.

1235
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:23,320
Did you really think
you could just say the word

1236
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,600
and I'd disappear from your life?

1237
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,960
That I would've lived
off your handouts in exile?

1238
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,400
No, Massimo. No.

1239
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:40,960
You finally showed your weakness.

1240
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:43,960
Question is,

1241
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:49,520
do you really think this little whore's
worth the whole empire our father created?

1242
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:57,920
Though I have to say,
she's not bad.

1243
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:12,080
Sometimes I wonder

1244
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:14,440
if your child

1245
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:17,160
would've looked more like you...

1246
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:19,800
